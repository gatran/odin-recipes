The start of learning Full Stack WebDev through TheOdinProject.com!

Although I have briefly worked with HTML, CSS and JS prior to this course, relearning this material is definitely important in the pursuit of potentially pivoting into becoming a Full Stack Web Developer (from a Data Science background)!

Since I am currently on Keto, these recipes will be Keto related ;).

Time spent to date: ~ 3 hours
